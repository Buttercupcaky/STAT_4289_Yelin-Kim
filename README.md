## Introduction
In biological research, twin studies have long been considered a crucial method for uncovering causal relationships by controlling for genetic and environmental factors within the same individual framework. Similarly, in the context of baseball, a player who performs both as a pitcher and a hitter represents an exceptionally rare but scientifically valuable case — one that allows researchers to observe two fundamentally different roles under the same physical and psychological conditions. Among such cases, Shohei Ohtani stands out as a unique modern example of successful two-way performance. His dual-role data provide an unprecedented opportunity to examine how pitching and hitting performances interact within a single athlete.
Traditionally, two-way players have emerged in leagues with lower competition levels or in teams with limited roster depth. However, the fact that the Los Angeles Dodgers, one of Major League Baseball’s most resource-rich and analytically advanced organizations, have adopted and optimized Ohtani’s two-way role reveals a deeper implication. It suggests that two-way performance is not merely the product of extraordinary individual talent, but a strategic response to modern roster constraints and efficiency needs.
In recent years, MLB teams have steadily increased the number of pitchers on active rosters from 11 pitchers in the 1980s to as many as 13 today leading to chronic shortages of position players. Consequently, the concept of a two-way player has been re-evaluated, no longer as a nostalgic experiment but as a practical solution for maximizing roster flexibility and team efficiency. This study aims to explore, through Ohtani’s data, both why two-way performance is possible and who could potentially become a successful two-way player.
By integrating Ohtani’s pitching and hitting data, this research seeks to identify the physiological, mechanical, and strategic mechanisms that enable dual-role performance. Ultimately, the findings are expected to provide empirical evidence that can support MLB teams — as well as professional baseball organizations worldwide — in efficiently developing future two-way players or determining optimal position transitions.
